# AltEquip

Addon for World of Warcraft Classic.

Help to keep track of your alts (alternative characters in game).

Still under development. Use at your own risk.

In the beginning I used this addon only to track current equipments, later I add more and more things (track professions, bags...). It is a little bit messy now. Need to polish or divide into multiple addons.

Slash commands:

- ***/alts*** # show all your alts, their levels and classes
- ***/altequip charname*** # show last known equipment of your alt charname
- ***/altitem SLOTNAME*** # show equipment in SLOTNAME slot of all your alts, eg. /altitem CHEST
- ***/altsk*** #show skill levels of your alts
- ***/altp*** #show profession levels of your alts
- ***/altb*** #show size of bags of your alts
- ***/altm*** #show last mails between your alts and if they have been delivered already
- ***/altn*** #show enchantment on chest, hands, legs, feet (enchantable by armor kits)
